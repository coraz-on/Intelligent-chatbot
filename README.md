# AI-Driven Customer Support Chatbot

This project demonstrates the implementation of an AI-driven customer support chatbot using FastAPI. The chatbot utilizes rule-based responses, machine learning-based responses, and integration with a backend system for enhanced user interactions.

## Features

- Rule-based responses for predefined user inputs.
- Machine learning-based responses using ChatterBot.
- Integration with a backend system for advanced processing.
- FastAPI integration for creating a web API.
- Natural Language Processing for intent recognition.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/coraz-on/Intelligent-chatbot.git
   cd customer-support-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. Open a web browser or use an API client to interact with the chatbot at `http://localhost:8000/chat`.

## Usage

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/chat` with a JSON payload containing a `"message"` field representing the user's input.

   Example Request:
   ```json
   {
       "message": "Hello, how can I help?"
   }
   ```

   Example Response:
   ```json
   {
       "response": "Hello! How can I assist you?"
   }
   ```

## Docker

You can also run the chatbot in a Docker container. Build the Docker image and run a container with the following commands:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t customer-support-chatbot .
   ```

2. Run a Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 customer-support-chatbot
   ```
